Viterbi Algorithm
*****************

1. Tags are states.
2. Words are observations.
3. Transition Probability : Probability of state transfer, eg : probability that one word is noun and next word in verb
4. Emission Probability : Probability of a particular observation in a particular state, eg: probability that one particular word in noun
5. For a given sentence "My name is Ram.", we want to predict the most likely tag sequence.
6. The formula for finding the most likely tag sequence is,
